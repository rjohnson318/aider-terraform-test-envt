#### add a public ip module  

Sure, I can help you with that. However, I need more information to proceed. 

1. What programming language should the module be written in?
2. What should the module do? Should it fetch the public IP of the current system or something else?
3. Where should this module be added? Please provide the directory path and the file name.

> ^C again or /exit to quit  

#### /exit
